1. file string from first occurrence of \ (backlash) to the end of the line
   [\\].*$
   
   \\ becomes \ (the first \ is escape char)
   .* means "any character, repeated 0 or more times".

2. Find count of characters from the end
   .{3}$ - 3 characters from the end
   .{3,5}$ - minimum of 3 characters to match; 5 is max. 3-5 characters from the end will match


Sample:
   [12]\d{3}-[01]\d-[0-3]\d (.*)\[(.*)\]:.*
