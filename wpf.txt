1. In code I can do this:
    this.DataContext = this;
    (I use it for binding to local clr-properties)
    How can I do that in xaml?

    you can give a x:Name to the root(Window) and use that in the binding
    DataContext="{Binding ElementName=window1}"
    
    You can also use a Binding with RelativeSource.  For example, this TextBox's background is specified by whatever you type into it:
    <TextBox
         DataContext="{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}}"
         Background="{Binding Path=Text}" />
